## Classification Prediction Problem

## Overview

This is the GitHub repository for a Stat 301-3 Regression Prediction Problem.
As part of a course-wide Kaggle competition, this project sought to predict Airbnb
rental price based on listing characteristics. A variety of machine learning
models were employed to reach an instructor-determined mean absolute error (MAE) threshold on Kaggle's
public leaderboard.

## Data Source

This final project utilizes an Airbnb listing dataset taken from the corresponding
Kaggle page.[^1]
